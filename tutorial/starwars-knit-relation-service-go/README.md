# ðŸ§¶ Knit Relation Service in Go

[Back to top of Tutorial]

In this tutorial the Knit relation service is implemented using [connect-go],
and is made to listen on address `http://localhost:18000`. Look at the process
diagram below to see where the Knit relation service fits into the bigger
picture.
